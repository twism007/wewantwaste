#WeWantWaste Demo

This project is a demo of a skip-hire interface built with React and Tailwind CSS. It features a responsive multi-step progress bar (TopBar) and a dynamic product selection component (Product) that fetches real-time skip data from an API.

Approach is to use a product-selection style component with dynamic rendering to allow users to select the skip type without cluttering the page.
The demo is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, showcasing the capabilities of React and Tailwind CSS in building modern web applications.
